Remember when your girlfriend got mad at you for not knowing what she said three years ago on Wednesday at 11.17 pm ? That‚Äôs exactly what a git commit is like. And if you‚Äôve been single all your life let me explain it to you in more detail.

It is important to write a commit message that is informative and it should actually make sense (don‚Äôt say your wish or you decide to your GF)

# git-commit documentation states:

_Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes._

# Why git-emoji is fun?

Programming, code is inherently flat and sometimes tiresome. git-emoji helps me to add faces, colours, and emotions.

To put in very simple, these are some of my commits before using emoji.

# Doesn‚Äôt look good with emoji than plain texts.? Of Course, Yes.

It makes it easy to understand once you get used with git-emoji. Mostly, it‚Äôs fun. üíÉ

# How to get started with git-emoji ?

To start using git-emoji in your commit messages from the command line you‚Äôll need to install gitmoji-cli.

‚ö†Ô∏èTake a break, npm install will take a longggggg time. ü§ê

(P.S: I was manual checking the emoji and adding it to my commit messages. Thanks to [Carlo](https://github.com/carloscuesta) for gitmoji-cli)

Once you installed as globally, then you are ready to commit message with emoji.

`gitmoji` is an interactive client for using gitmoji on commit messages.

Well done! You have successfully committed your message with emoji.

# Some gitmoji commands:

`gitmoji -l` ‚áí List all the available gitmojis

`gitmoji -s search_query`‚áí Search gitmojis

# Why do I think gitmoji is useful?

- Your today‚Äôs code is a future chronicle, so searching the commit messages will be hard. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that it will be meaningful for us.
- Incase of gitmoji, we can search for commit messages with emoji.
