I guess we need a little reminder on the rules, eh? Things are getting a little vitriolic, heated, and decidedly unfunny in here. I just need to come in for a minute and give you two of our rules, verbatim. Please follow them moving forward.

---

##Rule 5: The Unfunny Abuse Rule

* There is a clear and definitive line between humor and abuse. If your comment cannot be reasonably expected to make an audience laugh, and is instead meant to intimidate or threaten another user, your posted comment will be removed.

##Rule 12: The 'Don't Be Evil' Rule

* Do not make any comment that can be interpreted as wishing physical harm on someone or urging them to commit an act of violence on themselves or others.

* Do not make jokes at the expense of children, be they actual or implied.

* Do not make any comment that may be construed as malicious concerning anyone's race, religion, or sexual orientation/identity. This is a comedy subreddit. Be funny. Please remember the human.

---

Another matter I think needs clearing up: the mod team has been in contact with the journalist who submitted this roast and we have verified this account. Please stop reporting it.

---

And if you're new here, and don't understand what a roast is, or what we do here, I urge you to read the sidebar, the rules, and a few other comment sections before participating.

A roast is not an insult. A roast is not bullying. A roast is not delivered in anger. We're all here to enjoy this, both roastees and roasters. We're not here to make anyone feel *bad*, we want to get a laugh at each other's expense. We want to have fun. **We don't want to cross that hazy line into personal attacks and abuse.** That is not what RoastMe is for. That is not what Roasting is about.

This is a comedy subreddit. Please try to be funny."

>28 year old, lifelong freethinker. I've enjoyed skateboarding(street) since I was a kid. I still play CounterStrike Source. My favorite music genre is EDM, with Seven Lions at the forefront. I've experienced alot of paranormal and unexplainable things, which has led me to not be so quick to assume or believe, anything. I love wolves; have a few tattoos of them and they're integrated into alot of shit I own. I think politics are 100% rigged; I will watch the news and read between the lines just to get a feel for what's really going on. My voice has always been really deep, pitched somewhere between Denzel Washington and the Allstate guy. I've been staying pretty cool as we approach martial law; I'll give a shout out to my good friend, LSD, for the support. I'm also probably the last person on Earth who listens to t.A.T.u. Fuck you guys!!

We receive so many confused modmails about why your roast was rejected. It's because you're giving us a floating hand. We need to see *an unbroken meat tube between the Roastee's upper torso and the sign that they are holding*. This ensures consent, and eradicates almost any possibility of Photoshop, or holding a sign in front of your friend, or in front of a photo. This is important. This keeps the subreddit fun.

So please, when submitting a roast please ensure it includes your hand **and your arm**. Please. We're so tired of having this conversation.

ETA: We've gotten a couple comments about ableism and I just want to address that. If you don't have hands or arms or can't use your hands or arms we do make case by case exceptions to the rule. We just need to be 100% certain that the person in the photo is presenting the sign to us. Can't do that with floating hands.",1568145894.0,"> an unbroken meat tube

At OP's request we've released, unlocked, and, er, *sanitized* the thread. Some rule reminders going forward. Let me give you, verbatim, the second part of the Inappropriate Flattery rule:

* Everyone who posts here has consented to getting roasted, attempting to make them feel good about themselves only implies they are incapable of making their own voluntary choices and require special treatment.

We vet everyone who posts here. If they show any signs of current mental distress we do not allow them to post. Old scars aren't a sign of current mental distress.

And, guys, Rule 12. Please. Don't be evil. Don't tell her to cut down the road or the stream or the river or the fucking highway or whatever. It's tired, it's unfunny, and it's, frankly, violent conduct. Any violent comments may get you banned, as many in this thread found out. We do not abide that kind of nonsense here. 

People are here to be roasted. It's funny. It's fun. We're all consenting adults. People aren't here to be badgered and told to kill themselves. That's not what the subreddit is for.
