_Hacking is the gaining of unauthorised access to data in a system or computer. It‚Äôs more fun when things are gamified._

Out of boredom, I have started playing games on steam a lot. Thanks to COVID for bringing out the gamer in me that too in macOS. I started with Dota 2, Counter-Strike, and Overcooked 2. Then I came across a game called GreyHack.

# First Impressions:

- Easily understandable by the name itself, it was a type of tech game that involves gamified hacking experience.
- Costs 459 bucks (I have never spent that much money for a steam macOS game)

Then after my salary day, I bought [GreyHack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/). :P

GreyHack is a massively multiplayer hacking simulator game. You‚Äôre a hacker of full freedom to hack any machines in the game. The game allows the user to experience a single-player and multiplayer mode as well. Both the gameplays are more or less the same, but in multiplayer mode, you might have these differences:

- Any player in the game can hack your machine.
- You can chat with other players using the chat
- Buy hacking scripts from other hackers

The game‚Äôs interface replicates one of the Linux distributions with a terminal, File explorer, Text Editors, and few more essential applications.

If you start as a new hacker, getting the WiFi password is hard. Sometimes, you can get it from the Gift.txt file. If not, you have to hack the WiFi networks and get the password.

- You can visit the IP Address which you received from the anonymous person.

# Let‚Äôs do some dirty work:

- Grab `nmap` from the Shops Market, and do `nmap` on the victim.

- Dang üòé, we found something interesting here. Next, we will try to find exploits in Hacker Network.

- Check the description of the exploit and then get it. Here `gine5un5` and `odgescript` both get bank credentials, yet `odgescript` works only if the target machine has any active user whereas `gine5un5` does not have any restriction.

- Using the `browser` ; log in to other Bank Accounts and transfer the money to your account.

- Passwords are stored in `etc/passwd` . Copy the content to a text file and decipher the text file to obtain the root password.
- Modify the student‚Äôs academic grades after you open up `StudentViewer.exe` and save it.

# Do it neat and clear:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tlUzViHpCc-YypGhXtUeFg.png)

- Hackers don‚Äôt leave any trace behind. We have to make sure that the victim does not suspect anything weird or strange.
- Check the `LogViewer.exe` and delete the logs of your IP. _(If you fail to do this, the victim can hack you back and steal your money, mail account and so on)_

# Contract disclosure:
